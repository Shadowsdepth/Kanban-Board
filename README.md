## Description

Trying to get more familiar with using and implementing jwt inside my projects.
So this project was used to help me get more experience with that.

## Installation

Hopefully remember to put render link here

## Usage

I added encryption using jwt-token. It will allow you to stay logged in for a certain amount of time.
After that time runs out it should log you out automatically when you try and do something.
